# Image-caption-Genrator


This project is an **AI-powered Image Caption Generator** that automatically generates **descriptive captions** for images using deep learning. It combines **Computer Vision (CNNs)** for extracting features from images and **Natural Language Processing (LSTMs/Transformers)** for generating meaningful text descriptions. The model is trained on popular datasets like **Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MS COCO**, which contain thousands of images with human-written captions.  

The system first processes an image using a **pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like InceptionV3 or ResNet50** to extract key visual features. These features are then passed to a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers** or an **attention-based Transformer model**, which generates a caption word by word. The generated captions are evaluated using **BLEU, CIDEr, and ROUGE scores** to measure accuracy and quality.  

The project includes a **Streamlit-based web application**, where users can upload an image and receive an AI-generated caption instantly. It also supports a **command-line interface** for testing images. The model can be further improved by using **advanced Transformers like ViT + BERT or GPT-2**, adding **beam search for better caption generation**, and **deploying as an API for real-world applications**.  

Technologies used include **TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, NLTK, and Hugging Face Transformers** for training and text generation. This project has applications in **automated image annotation, accessibility for visually impaired users, and AI-driven content creation**. It serves as an innovative step towards **helping machines understand and describe the visual world with human-like accuracy**.
